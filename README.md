# 📊 Ad Spending vs. Revenue - Linear Regression

This project uses **Linear Regression** to analyze the relationship between **advertising spending and revenue**. It helps predict how much revenue a company can generate based on its marketing budget.

## 🚀 Overview
Marketing teams often ask:  
*"How much revenue will we generate if we increase our ad budget?"*  

This project answers that question using **Machine Learning**. We take historical ad spend data and train a **Linear Regression model** to predict future revenue.
